    "### Top-down Program Design (a.k.a. Wishful Programming)\n",
    "\n",
    "**Top-down Design**: Top-down program design is a particular software engineering strategy. The core idea is to divide the program up into individual components (functions, objects) that operate independently through a clearly defined interface. \n",
    "\n",
    "Initially, these components act like black boxes -- we wish/assume they were already implemented and work correctly. Then, we repeat the design process for each black box, potentially decomposing it into other components.\n",
    "\n",
    "\n",
    "This is a form of **functional abstraction**: Initially, we do not have to worry about **how** each component is implemented. We just have to understand **what** it is supposed to do. \n",
    "\n",
    "The top down process also supports collaboration between multiple developers. Each developer completes their own component, adhering to the design specification. Then, putting the compoients back together, the entire project should work. \n",
    "\n",
    "Individual components are also easier to test.\n",
    "\n",
    "In AI-assisted programming, Top-Down programming is a useful strategy where AI can be used to generate code for individual components. Typically LLMs perform better on smaller units with clear design specifications than on complete projects. The quality of each component is also easier to verify. \n",
    "\n",
    "Let's see an example of how we can put this definition into practice. We will design a non-trivial program. We will use functions to divide a larger, intimidating problem into manageable chunks that could be implemented incrementally and independently."

This is known as **Duck Typing** (*if it looks like a duck and quacks like a duck, it's a duck*). In Python, we can implement certain special methods to allow objects to be used using built-in Python syntax (for example, comparisons with <, >, ==).\n",
